what is an observable?
	An Observable basically can be thought of as a data source 
	Observable basically just is an object we import from a RxJS package.
	The observable object is implemented in a way that it follows the observable pattern.
	The Service class behaves like a Observable and the Component class behaves likes subscriber/observer. 
	In between, we have a stream, a timeline and on this timeline, we can have multiple events emitted by the observable or data packages
	observable can be connected with the button click and observable can be connected to a HTTP request.

What are the ways of handling data packages?
	There  are three types of data packages you can receive from the observable to subscriber.
	handling data
	handling error
	handle the completion of the observable
		data =>
		errors =>
		
	some observables doesn't have the completion
	Exmaple: A button click
	some observables does have the completion
	Exmaple: 
	HTTP request will have a clear end and will complete eventually

observables are that stream of data and whenever a new
data piece is emitted, our subscription will know about it.
