What is component?
Components are the main building block for Angular applications. 
Each component consists of:
		An HTML template that declares what renders on the page.
		A TypeScript class that defines behavior.
		A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template.
		Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template.
