What is difference between angularJs and angular?
	Architecture
		AngularJS uses MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture
			Model contains the business logic.
			Controller gets the data from Model, it process the data and exposes data to view.
			View shows data to the users.
		Angular replaces controllers with components.
		Components are nothing but directives with a predefined template.					
	Language
		AngularJS uses JavaScript language, which is a dynamically typed language.
		Angular uses TypeScript language, which is a statically typed language and is a superset of JavaScript.
	Mobile Support
		AngularJS does not provide mobile support.
		Angular is supported by all popular mobile browsers.
	Version
		Angularjs was introduced in 2010. it is written in javascript, It is also called as Angular1
		Angular framework was introduced in 2016, it uses typescript as programming language.
			It is completly rewritten framework, it is not related with angularjs. we are calling it as Angular2.
			Angular2
			Angular3 xxx
			Angular4
			...
			...
			Angular11
			Angular12

What is the difference between javascript and typescript?
	typescript superset of JavaScript
	javascript runs in the broswer directly, compilation phase is not required.
	typescript won't run in the browser directly, it requires compilation phase.
	the compiler will takes .ts file as input and generates the .js file as output.
	Angular uses the Ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler.

	and each file compiled seperatly.

	 it compiled by the machine itself using cli
	 all code compiled together.suitable for production builds.

What is pipes?

What is lazy loading?
What is view encapsulation?
	The template and style defined within the component can effect the whole application or vice versa. Angular provides three encapsulation stratagies.
	They are
		1.Emulated -> styles from the main HTML propagate to the component.
		2.Native-> Styles from the main HTML don't propagate to the component.
		3.None->Styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and therfore it visible for all components on the page.
What is difference between TDF and Reactive forms?
Template Driven Froms:--> 
	It used in simple forms like login page. with two way data binding.
	We can simply assign value to variable from ui and vice versa.

	Easy to use
	Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
	Similar to AngularJS
	Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
	Minimal component
	Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
	Unit testing is another challenge.
	
	Simple example is if we are givng two way binding for the below input.
	<input [(ngModel)]="username">
	
	We can simply display the value that user is giving in the UI.
	<p>Hello {{username}}!</p>
	
Reactive forms:-->
	Complex forms with more number of fields.
	Multiple complex validation are there. Custom validations are required.
	Require JSON structure to be send with the values in the form.
	
	More flexible, but needs a lot of practice

	Handles any complex scenarios
	More component code and less HTML markup
	Reactive transformations can be made possible such as
	Handling a event based on a debounce time
	Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
	Adding elements dynamically
	Easier unit testing.
