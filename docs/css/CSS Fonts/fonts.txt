CSS Fonts:
	In CSS there are five generic font families:

	-> Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
	-> Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
	-> Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
	-> Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
	-> Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
