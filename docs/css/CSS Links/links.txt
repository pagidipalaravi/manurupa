CSS Links:
	Links can be styled with any CSS property
	Ex: color, bakground-color etc.,
	
	links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

		The four links states are:
			a:link - a normal, unvisited link
			a:visited - a link the user has visited
			a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
			a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
