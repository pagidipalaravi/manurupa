What is difference between angularJs and angular?
Architecture
	AngularJS uses MVC or Model-View-Controller architecture, where the Model contains the business logic, Controller processes information and View shows the information present in the Model.
	Angular replaces controllers with Components. Components are nothing but directives with a predefined template.
								
Language
	AngularJS uses JavaScript language, which is a dynamically typed language.
	Angular uses TypeScript language, which is a statically typed language and is a superset of JavaScript. By using statically typed language, Angular provides better performance while developing larger applications.

Mobile Support
	AngularJS does not provide mobile support.
	Angular is supported by all popular mobile browsers.

What is interceptors?
	this is a unique type angular service.
	we can implement interseptors allow us intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HTTPClient.
What is Dependency Injection?
	By using angular Di to increase the flexibility and modularity in your application.
what is difference between JIT and AOT?
	jit and AOT both are same compilers 
	JIT-just in time
	jit compiles your application in the browser at run time. it is suitable for local development. and each file compiled seperatly.
	AOT- Ahead-of- time
	 it compiled by the machine itself using cli
	 all code compiled together.suitable for production builds.
What is pipes?
	it takes data as input transform into output.
What is lazy loading?
What is view encapsulation?
	The template and style defined within the component can effect the whole application or vice versa. Angular provides three encapsulation stratagies.
	They are
		1.Emulated -> styles from the main HTML propagate to the component.
		2.Native-> Styles from the main HTML don't propagate to the component.
		3.None->Styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and therfore it visible for all components on the page.
What is difference between TDF and Reactive forms?
Template Driven Froms:--> 
	It used in simple forms like login page. with two way data binding.
	We can simply assign value to variable from ui and vice versa.

	Easy to use
	Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
	Similar to AngularJS
	Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
	Minimal component
	Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
	Unit testing is another challenge.
	
	Simple example is if we are givng two way binding for the below input.
	<input [(ngModel)]="username">
	
	We can simply display the value that user is giving in the UI.
	<p>Hello {{username}}!</p>
	
Reactive forms:-->
	Complex forms with more number of fields.
	Multiple complex validation are there. Custom validations are required.
	Require JSON structure to be send with the values in the form.
	
	More flexible, but needs a lot of practice

	Handles any complex scenarios
	More component code and less HTML markup
	Reactive transformations can be made possible such as
	Handling a event based on a debounce time
	Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
	Adding elements dynamically
	Easier unit testing.
