1.What is interceptors?
	this is a unique type angular service.
	we can implement interseptors allow us intercept incoming or outgoing HTTP requests using the HTTPClient.
2.What is Dependency Injection?
	By using angular Di to increase the flexibility and modularity in your application.
3.what is difference between JIT and AOT?
	jit and AOT both are same compilers 
	JIT-just in time
	jit compiles your application in the browser at run time. it is suitable for local development. and each file compiled seperatly.
	AOT- Ahead-of- time
	 it compiled by the machine itself using cli
	 all code compiled together.suitable for production builds.
4.What is pipes?
	it takes data as input transform into output.
5.What is lazy loading?
6. What is view encapsulation?
	The template and style defined within the component can effect the whole application or vice versa. Angular provides three encapsulation stratagies.
	They are
		1.Emulated -> styles from the main HTML propagate to the component.
		2.Native-> Styles from the main HTML don't propagate to the component.
		3.None->Styles from the component propagate back to the main HTML and therfore it visible for all components on the page.
7.What is difference between TDF and Reactive forms?
Template Driven Froms:--> 
	It used in simple forms like login page. with two way data binding.
	We can simply assign value to variable from ui and vice versa.

	Easy to use
	Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
	Similar to AngularJS
	Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
	Minimal component
	Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
	Unit testing is another challenge.
	
	Simple example is if we are givng two way binding for the below input.
	<input [(ngModel)]="username">
	
	We can simply display the value that user is giving in the UI.
	<p>Hello {{username}}!</p>
	
Reactive forms:-->
	Complex forms with more number of fields.
	Multiple complex validation are there. Custom validations are required.
	Require JSON structure to be send with the values in the form.
	
	More flexible, but needs a lot of practice

	Handles any complex scenarios
	More component code and less HTML markup
	Reactive transformations can be made possible such as
	Handling a event based on a debounce time
	Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
	Adding elements dynamically
	Easier unit testing.

	1. Angular is built is using typescript.
2. Implement responsive navigation using bootstrap and angular?
3. Implement table with pagination?
4. What is module?
 	Collection of components is called module, which can perform specific task.
4. How to check the rest url is working or not?
	By using postman.
5.  What is difference between null and undefined in Javascript?
	Undefined: It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.
	var demo;
	alert(demo); //shows undefined
	Null:
	var demo = null;
	alert(demo); //shows null
6. How to invoke the rest services in angular?
	by using httpclient module.
8. How the angular app gets started first?
9. What happen when open the angular app in the browser?
10. What is a basic building block of angular?
	Modules	, components, data bindings, directives, services, dependency injection these all are the basic building blocks in angular. 
	
11.What is starting page of angular app?
	main.ts
	app.module.ts
		@NgModule
			declaration
			imports
			providers
			bootstrap
				app.component
12. How to create component with in the folder?
	ng g c  foldername/component name.
12. what is the root component in angular?
 	Main.ts file is root component in angular.
13. Whare is app root component is configured?
	App root component is configured in app.component.ts file 
	@component({
		Selector: ‘app-root’})
14. What happen when you run ng serve command from CLI?
	To build and serve the application.
	The CLI supports a live browser reload experience. 
	Using this Url “http://localhost:4200”
	
15. What is difference between promise and observable?
 Observable: 
	Observable is a synchronized (sequential). 
	Once you initiate the request we can cancel the request. 
	We will use observables to retrieve the large volume of data like arrays, collections, map and list. 
Promise:
	Promise is an asynchronous (parallel)
	Once you initiate the request we cannot cancel the request.
	We will use promise for to retrieve single value or error message.


16.What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous?
	Synchronous: If your calling one rest request it will wait until execution completes.
	Asynchronous: you can call multiple rest requests parallely.  

17.How to execute some logic the time of component load or page load?
	Implement the “OnInit” class and override the “ngOnit” method.
18. How to call rest services?
	Create a service package and service classes and add the service classes in the in the provider section of app.module.ts 
	Use the HttpClient angular library and request methods.
19. What is angular life cycle?
	Angular calls lifecycle hook methods on directives and components as it creates, changes, and destroys them.
	OnInit
	ngOnInit
  	
20. If I want to execute some logic at time of class initialization in angular?

21. Where we have to write that logic?

22. How to add bootstrap in angular?
	Go to “angular.json” file 
	Then select “styles”:[
	“node_Modules/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css/bootstrap.min.css.
(Or)
	Following bootstrap CDNs in index.html file

23. How to install bootstrap in angular cli?

26. How many ways to add bootstrap in angular project?

	•	Including the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the <head> section of the index.html file of your Angular project with a <link> and <script> tags.
	•	Importing the Bootstrap CSS file in the global styles.css file of your Angular project with an @import keywords.
	•	Adding the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the styles and scripts arrays of the angular.json file of your project
	
How many angular form approaches there?

	Template driven forms and reactive forms

How to choose the angular form approach?

	Reactive Forms: reactive forms are most robust, scalable, testable and reusable. It is using small login forms. It is used to “reactive formModules”.
	Template-Driven Forms: Template driven forms are used in basic form requirements and logic that can be managed soley in the template, template driven forms are good fit for bigger applications. It mostly uses in directives. And “formModule”.

What are the difference between TDF and RF? 
	•	Template-driven forms make use of the "FormsModule", while reactive forms are based on "ReactiveFormsModule".
	•	Template-driven forms are asynchronous in nature, whereas Reactive forms are mostly synchronous.


What is difference between mutable and immutable?

	Template driven forms are unstructured and mutable and reactive forms are structured and immutable. 


Can we access TDF values without using  Viewchild?

	yes we can access 

	form.value.firstname

What is difference between dirty-touch and in-valid in TDF? 
	if you are touched and enter the value is dirty in that dirty is error then become a invalid.
	1. Touched 
	2. Dirty
	3. Invalid
	The difference between touched and dirty is that with touched the user doesn’t need to actually change the value of the input control.
How to implement logging in ui applications?
	Console.error();
	Console.info();
	Console.warn();
	Console.log();
