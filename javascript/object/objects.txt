What is object?
	Object is an instance of a class. Object is a physical entity.
	Wihtout class we can't create object.
	object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method
	JavaScript is an object-based language. 
	Everything is an object in JavaScript.
Creating Objects in JavaScript:
	1.By object literal
	2.By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
	3.By using an object constructor (using new keyword)
	1.Creating objects literal:
		As you can see, property and value is separated by : (colon).
			Example:
				emp={id:102,name:"Shyam Kumar",salary:40000}  
				document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);
				
	2.By creating instance of Object:
		Here, new keyword is used to create object.
		syntax:
			var refname=new ObjectName();  
		Example:
			var emp=new Object();  
			emp.id=101;  
			emp.name="Ravi Malik";  
			emp.salary=50000;  
			document.write(emp.id+" "+emp.name+" "+emp.salary);  
			
	3.By using an Object constructor:
		Here, you need to create function with arguments. 
		Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword.
		The this keyword refers to the current object.
		Example:
			function emp(id,name,salary){  
			this.id=id;  
			this.name=name;  
			this.salary=salary;  
			}  
			e=new emp(103,"Vimal Jaiswal",30000);  
			  
			document.write(e.id+" "+e.name+" "+e.salary);
