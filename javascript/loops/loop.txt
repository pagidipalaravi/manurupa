What is for loop?

Syntax:

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	// write your code it may be single line or 100 lines
	//it will execute multiple time based upon the the condition
}
Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	console.log("This is my logic i want to execute 10 times"+i);
	
}
// array index = 5 length = 6;

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford", "Fiat", "Audi"];

for (let i = 1 ; i < cars.length; i++) {
	console.log(cars[i]);
}
