What is function?

	function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
	function is executed when "something" invokes it(calls it).
	syntax:
	function function_name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, ... parametern) {
		//block of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code] designed to perform a particular task
	}
	Exmaple:
	createEmployee(firstName ,lastName, phoneNo){
		//block of code [sometime we will write 100 lines of code] designed to perform a particular task
	}
	createEmployee("ravi" ,"kumar", 9912456789);

	parameters are listed inside the paranthesis() in the function definition.
	arguements are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
	Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

what is function invokation?
	The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes(calls) the function.
====	
what is function return?
	When function reaches "return" statement, the function will stop executing.
	If the function was invoked from a statement, javascript will "return" to execute the code after invoking statement.
	Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"
	Syntax
	function functionName () {
		//block of code
		return somthing;
	}
	Example
	function addition(n1, n2) {
		let res = n1 + n2;
		return res;
	}
====
Why Functions?
	You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
	You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
--
The () Operator Invokes the Function
Accessing a function with () will return the function result.
Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
	Syntax
	functionName();
	Example
	addition(10, 20);
--
Functions Used as Variable Values
	syntax
	let variableName = functionName();
	Example
	let varaibleValue = addition(10, 20);
--
Local Variables
	Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
	Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
	Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
	Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.
	Syntax
	function functionName () {
		let n1;
		let n2;
		let res;
		//block of code
		return res;
	}
	Example
	function addition() {
		let n1 =10;
		let n2 =20;
		let res = n1 + n2;
		//block of code
		return res;
	}
