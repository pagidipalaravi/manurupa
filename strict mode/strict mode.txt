what is strict mode?
	Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
	Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
	It defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".
	Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
	syntax:
			"use strict";
	example:
			"use strict";
			let x = 3.14;
			console.log(x);
	uses of strict mode:
		The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5.
		It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
		The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
		With strict mode, you can not use undeclared variables.
