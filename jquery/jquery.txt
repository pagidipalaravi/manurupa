	what is the difference between uncompressed and minified ?
Introduction
What would you know already?
	Before you start studying jquery, you should know basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
If everything is possible using javascript, then why we need to use jquery? 
what is jQuery?
	jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
	The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
	jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

why jQuery?
	There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.
	Many of the biggest companies on the Web use jQuery, such as:
	1. Google
	2. Microsoft
	3. IBM
	4. Netflix	
Will jquery work in all browsers?
	jquery will run exactly the same in all major browsers.
	JQuery is well tested in all browsers.

How to use jquery into your web application?
	 
	First way 
		Download the jquery from jquery.com
		Include downloaded jquery file by using <script> tag.
	second way
		Include jquery fromm CDN, like Google.
What is the difference between production version and development version?
	Production version: this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed.
	Development version: This is testing and development(uncompressed and readable).
What is jquery CDN?
	If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
	Google is an example of someone who host jQuery:
	example: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>.

What is the use of jquery syntax?
	The jQuery syntax is tailor-made for selecting HTML elements and performing some action on the element(s).
	$(selector).action();
	Here,  $ sign to define/access jQuery
			(selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
			jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)
		
	 Examples:
		$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
		$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
		$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
		$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".
		
Document Ready event:
		$(document).ready(function(){
		// jQuery methods go here...
		 });
	This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).

JQuery selectors:
	jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
	jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes.
	All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().
	
	1. Element selector:
		The jQuery element selector selects elements based on the element name.
		You can select all <p> elements on a page like this: $("p")
		Examples:
			<script>
				$(document).ready(function(){
				  $("button").click(function(){
					$("p").hide();
				  });
				});
			</script>
			<body>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
				<button>Click me to hide paragraphs</button>
			</body>
	2. Id selector:
		The jQuery #id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.
		An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the #id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.
		To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character.
		syntax:
			$("#Selector");
		Examples:
			<script>
				$(document).ready(function(){
				  $("button").click(function(){
					$("#test").hide();
				  });
				});
			</script>
			<body>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p id="test">This is another paragraph.</p>
				<button>Click me to hide paragraphs</button>
			</body>
	3. class selector:
		The jQuery .class selector finds elements with a specific class.
		syntax:
			$(".Selector");
		Examples:
			<script>
				$(document).ready(function(){
				  $("button").click(function(){
					$(".test").hide();
				  });
				});
			</script>
			<body>
				<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
				<p class="test">This is another paragraph.</p>
				<button>Click me to hide paragraphs</button>
			</body>
		
What are the jquery events?
	jQuery is tailor-made to respond to events in an HTML page.
	All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.
	An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
	example:
		moving a mouse over an element.
		selecting a radio button.
		clicking on an element.
	syntax:
